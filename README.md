Karma CSS is a great starting point if you only want a barebones css boilerplate.
The project builds upon where the original skeleton css project left off. This is not a UI framework but it is the starting point for one.

This includes normalize, a powerful mobile-first flexbox grid system, all base styles, useful mixins, the ability to set your own button colors and more. 

Minified and gzipped it weighs less than 5kb.

The documentation can be found at [karmacss.com](http://karmacss.com). We also have some useful component examples like
button dropdowns and tooltips, more of which are being added daily.
