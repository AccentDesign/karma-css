# Start CSS Boilerplate

Start CSS Boilerplate is a mobile first, responsive starting point of a CSS framework built on top of normalize and a powerful flexbox grid system.

## Our Aim

Our aim is to provide a sensible set of CSS defaults that DO NOT impose any style on the end result. But provides enough base building blocks to quickly get started and aid construction of your site. 

We support all modern browsers and back to IE10.

## Whats included?

* All fixes from Normalize.css for supported browsers 
* A powerful flex based grid system that has multiple configurable breakpoints and columns.
* Variables to:
    * customize the default look of form fields, buttons, tables, fonts and more.
    * creating of additional button styles.
    * defining system wide colours to use will in turn create helpers to set font and background colours to use in your html.
    * easily keep track of z-index layers and avoid issues like `zindex:99999`.
* Several useful mixins such as:
    * responsive breakpoints
    * clearfix
    * css-triangle
    * box-shadow
* Lots of additional helper classes.
