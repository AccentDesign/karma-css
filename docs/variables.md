# Variables

See below all the current variables and their defaults set in Karma CSS

!!! note
    Its worth noting that when defining your own **colours** or **buttons**
    you dont need to copy all of them. You can start with an empty list, the existing ones
    will be merged in with yours. You will be left with your own and any from the defaults 
    you did not define.

        // start with these
        $colors: ();
        $buttons: ();

```scss
{!../scss/_variables.scss!}
```
