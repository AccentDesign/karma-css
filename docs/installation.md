# Installation

## Using the Starter Project

The quickest way to get started is use the starter project from 
[Github](https://github.com/AccentDesign/karma-css-starter).
Either by cloning as below or you can download the 
[latest version here](https://github.com/AccentDesign/karma-css-starter/archive/master.zip).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AccentDesign/karma-css-starter.git
```

Then simply run the following:

```bash
npm install
npm run watch-css
```

## Other Installation Methods

The package can be installed through npm:

```bash
npm install karma-css --save
```

Or bower:

```bash
bower install karma-css
```

Or by cloning the repo over at [Github](https://github.com/AccentDesign/karma-css):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AccentDesign/karma-css.git

Or if you only want the default grid, styles and utility helpers you can use a cdn:

```
